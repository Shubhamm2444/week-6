# netlify.toml (or netlify.yml) file

site:
  name: My Library App
  # Point to your built static files directory
  build: public

# Configure database connection (replace with your actual database details)
# This is just an example, and static hosting doesn't handle databases directly.
environment:
  DB_HOST: localhost
  DB_USER: username
  DB_PASSWORD: password

**  Explanation:

This YAML file configures Netlify with your project name and build directory.
The database connection example is for illustration only. Static hosting doesn't handle databases directly.
