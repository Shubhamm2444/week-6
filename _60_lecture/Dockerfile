** Containerization (using Docker):

# Use a base image with your chosen language runtime (e.g., node:16)
FROM node:16

# Copy your application code
WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .

# Expose port for web server
EXPOSE 3000

# Start your application (replace with your actual command)
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]


Explanation:

This Dockerfile defines a container image with your application code and dependencies.
It exposes the port on which your application listens (e.g., port 3000).
You'll need to build and push the image to a container registry for deployment.
