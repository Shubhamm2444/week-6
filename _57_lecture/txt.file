A library application can refer to two main things:
Library management software: This is a software program used by librarians to manage the library's collection, including books, ebooks, audiobooks, movies, and other media. It helps them catalog items, track borrowing and returns, manage membership information, and generate reports.
Library user application: This is a mobile app or web interface that allows library patrons to search the library catalog, place holds on items, check their borrowing history, renew loans, and access digital resources.
There are also library applications that are more specific, such as:

Reference management applications: These applications help students and researchers organize their research materials, such as journal articles and books.
E-reader applications: These applications allow users to read ebooks on their smartphones, tablets, or computers.
