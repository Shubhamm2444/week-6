Simple Command Line Library Management System (Python):

This is a basic program that allows users to add, search, and list books in a library.


books = []

def add_book():
  title = input("Enter book title: ")
  author = input("Enter book author: ")
  books.append({"title": title, "author": author})
  print("Book added successfully!")

def search_book():
  title = input("Enter book title to search: ")
  for book in books:
    if book["title"] == title:
      print(f"Book found: {book['title']} by {book['author']}")
      return
  print("Book not found.")

def list_books():
  if not books:
    print("There are no books in the library.")
    return
  print("List of Books:")
  for book in books:
    print(f"- {book['title']} by {book['author']}")

while True:
  print("\nLibrary Management System")
  print("1. Add Book")
  print("2. Search Book")
  print("3. List Books")
  print("4. Exit")

  choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

  if choice == '1':
    add_book()
  elif choice == '2':
    search_book()
  elif choice == '3':
    list_books()
  elif choice == '4':
    break
  else:
    print("Invalid choice.")
