 Library Application 
The term "library application" can refer to two things:
Library management system: This is a software program used by libraries to track their inventory, manage borrowing and returns of materials, and handle member accounts. These systems are typically used by librarians and administrators
Public library app: This is a mobile app that allows library patrons to search the library catalog, place holds on materials, manage their accounts, and access digital resources. These apps are designed for the convenience of library users.
