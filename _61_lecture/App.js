2. React Client Deployment (using Netlify):
React App (App.js):

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [books, setBooks] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchBooks = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('https://your-api-endpoint.com/books'); // Replace with your deployed API URL
      const data = await response.json();
      setBooks(data);
    };
    fetchBooks();
  }, []);

  // ... (rest of your React component logic)
}

export default App;

** Explanation:
This React component fetches book data from the deployed API endpoint URL.
Update the https://your-api-endpoint.com/books URL with your actual deployed API URL.

** Deployment to Netlify:
Build your React application for production (npm run build).
Connect your Netlify account to your Git repository.
Netlify will automatically deploy your built static files upon code changes.

** Benefits of this approach:
The API code is separate and scalable using a serverless approach.
The React client is easily deployed using a static hosting platform.
Environment variables manage the API endpoint URL for different deployment environments.

 ** Important Note:
This is a simplified example.  Real-world deployments involve additional configurations for security, access control, and error handling. Remember to consult the official documentation for AWS Lambda and Netlify for detailed deployment instructions.
